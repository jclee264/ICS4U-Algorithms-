  ## Base Project information:
   * Type of Cubes: Pyraminx duo, pyraminx and 2x2
   * I can solve the pyraminx duo
      * I am currently using the 4 step method learned with the video in class. 
      * The goal of this method is to solve the pyramix duo in 4 moves or less (depending on the scramble)
   * I have never solved a pyraminx or 2x2

  ## Project Conclusion:
   * Type of cubes I can now solve: Pyraminx duo, pyraminx and 2x2
   * I found the pyraminx the hardest to solve, the 2x2 made a lot more sense to me personally than the pyraminx
   * The pyraminx duo was the easiest to sovle, but the 2x2 was a close second
   * The 2x2 took the most effort to learn how to solve, memorizing algorithms with different scenarios, etc. but it was the most rewarding when I could finally solve it.
   * Overall a good introductory project to the course with lots learnt
